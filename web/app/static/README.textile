h1. WebCore 2 Static File Application

This application allows you to "mount" on-disk directories to parts of your own application.

There are three methods of delivering the files:

# Stream the file from disk through a standard response.
# Use the @X-Sendfile@ header to instruct a front-end load balancer to deliver the file.
# Use kernel-level sendfile support from the host server.
